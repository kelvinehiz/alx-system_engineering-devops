This project contains the screenshots from my progress in the CMDCHALLENGE.

CMD CHALLENGE is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. Itâ€™s a good training to improve your command line skills!

To use the SFTP command line tool, we first connect to the alx server using the SFTP and password on the webterm page, from your local machine. 

Make sure you navigate to the command_line_for_win directory that you must have created by first using ssh. Then navigate to where your screenshots are on your local machine using the lcd command. 

When on the path where your screenshots are, use the "put" command to add the screenshots to the command_line_for_the_win directory directly.
