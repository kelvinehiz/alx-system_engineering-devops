# SSH

In this project, We see how to  connect to and work with servers using the SSH protocol. I worked on a server
provided by ALX.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

  * [0-use_a_private_key](./0-use_a_private_key): Bash script that uses `ssh` to connect to my
Holberton-provided server.

  * [1-create_ssh_key_pair](./1-create_ssh_key_pair): Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

  * [2-ssh_config](./2-ssh_config): SSH configuration file configured to use the private key
`~/.ssh/holberton` and to refuse authentication using a password.
